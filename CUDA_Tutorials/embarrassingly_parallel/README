Find the closest point to each point in a set of 10000 given points.

Fastest CPU run takes 186 milliseconds.
Fastest GPU run takes 26 milliseconds.

Ways to improve GPU time-
1) Loop through the second parameter (number of threads per block) in the launch coniguration as multiples of 32 and get the optimized value for faster GPU performance.
2) When comparing CPU vs GPU, ensure Target Machine Platform is the same, i.e., either 32-bit or 64-bit
3) Set appropriate 'compute' and 'sm' settings of the GPU
